# Day 1 ‚Äì NMOS Id vs Vds Characteristics (Sky130, SPICE Simulation)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to Circuit Design and SPICE Simulations

In VLSI design, understanding transistor behavior is crucial for building digital and analog circuits. Before fabricating a chip, engineers simulate circuits using SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) to verify functionality and performance.
‚úÖ Why Circuit Design?

Real-world circuits use MOSFETs (NMOS/PMOS) as switches or amplifiers.
Engineers must know how current flows with different voltages.
Simulation helps predict behavior without physical hardware.

‚úÖ Why SPICE Simulations?

SPICE allows us to:
Analyze DC, AC, and Transient characteristics.
Model real transistor behavior using foundry data.
Test different bias conditions safely.
Measure parameters like Id, Vt, gm, ro, etc.

‚úÖ Basic SPICE Flow

Write Netlist (circuit description in text)
Include Technology/Model File (.lib or .model)
Specify simulation commands
Run simulation
Plot and analyze results

‚úÖ In Day 1, our goal is to understand how NMOS drain current (Id) changes with Vds under different Vgs values, both theoretically and using SPICE.

2Ô∏è‚É£ NMOS Structure & 4-Terminal Device
An NMOS (N-Channel MOSFET) is the fundamental building block of digital IC design. It acts as a voltage-controlled current device.
It consists of:
A p-type substrate
Two n+ diffusion regions ‚Üí Source & Drain
A thin SiO‚ÇÇ (oxide) layer
A Gate terminal on top of the oxide

‚úÖ Physical Structure (Conceptual View)


‚úÖ The Four Terminals of MOSFET
| Terminal  | Symbol | Function                                       |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Gate      | G      | Controls channel formation (voltage input)     |
| Source    | S      | Where carriers (electrons) enter               |
| Drain     | D      | Where carriers leave                           |
| Body/Bulk | B      | Substrate (usually connected to Source or GND) |

‚úÖ Default Biasing in NMOS

Source (S): Ground (0V)
Body (B): Ground (to avoid body effect)
Gate (G): Positive voltage (Vgs)
Drain (D): Positive voltage (Vds)

‚úÖ NMOS Conduction Mechanism

When Vgs < Vt ‚Üí MOSFET OFF (No channel)
When Vgs = Vt ‚Üí Channel just forms (weak inversion)
When Vgs > Vt ‚Üí Strong inversion ‚Üí Electrons form n-type channel ‚Üí Current flows from Drain to Source if Vds > 0

üìå Important: Electrons flow from Source to Drain, but current Id is defined from Drain to Source.

‚úÖ PMOS (for reference)

Built in n-substrate
Diffusion: p+ regions
Gate voltage must be negative
Carriers: Holes
Works opposite to NMOS
