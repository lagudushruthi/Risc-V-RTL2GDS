## Introduction

**Static Timing Analysis (STA)** validates digital circuit timing by analyzing all possible signal paths against system constraints—no input vectors required. This ensures timing correctness for flops, latches, and I/O ports by consulting netlist, constraints, and library data.

---

## STA Fundamentals

- **Checks:** Setup/hold violations, slack margin.
- **Constraints:** Defined by system clocks and design rules.
- **Library:** Provides cell delays, setup/hold margins, clk-to-q values.

---

## Key Concepts & Definitions

- **Timing Path:** Signal flow from startpoint (like a clock pin or input port) to endpoint (D pin of flop or output).
- **Arrival Time:** When a signal reaches its destination.
- **Required Time:** Latest timing allowed by system specs.
- **Slack:** Difference between required time and arrival time—negative slack warns of timing failure.
- **Setup Time:** Minimum interval before clock when data must remain stable.
- **Hold Time:** Minimum interval after clock when data remains stable.

## Video Section Summaries

### Timing Graphs & Calculations

- Gates are nodes in a timing graph; nets are edges.
- Compute AAT (Actual Arrival Time) for each node.
- Compute RAT (Required Arrival Time) according to constraint specs.
- Check slack (RAT - AAT) at each node; positive means passing, negative means failing.
- Multiple timing paths connect launch/capture flops or I/O points; each must be analyzed.

### Setup/Hold, Clk-to-q and Jitter

- **Setup:** Data arrives before clock by setup time.
- **Hold:** Data remains after clock by hold time.
- **Clk-to-q Delay:** Measured from clock edge to Q output change; extracted from cell library.
- **Jitter:** Clock variability seen in eye diagrams; reduces available timing margin.

### Graphical vs Textual Setup/Hold

- Both representations map and validate the setup/hold timing at all possible paths.
- Real clock sources must be considered to accurately model timing.
- Transition between sketches and textual checklists clarifies complex paths—for example, four paths in a simple sequential circuit.

### On-Chip Variation (OCV)

- **Sources:** Etching, oxide thickness, and resistance/current changes all inject delay variability.
- Designs must plan for worst-case path delays by applying OCV margining.

### OCV Timing & Pessimism Removal

- Timing analysis repeats with OCV factors on delays and constraints.
- Pessimism (overly conservative safety margin) can produce false fails. Techniques like common-path pessimism removal help restore true design margin.

## Formulas Quick Reference

- **Slack:**  
  \[
    \text{Slack} = \text{Required Arrival Time} - \text{Actual Arrival Time}
  \]

- **Setup Slack:**  
  \[
    \text{Setup Slack} = \text{Clock Period} - (\text{Data Arrival Time} + \text{Setup Time})
  \]

- **Hold Slack:**  
  \[
    \text{Hold Slack} = \text{Data Arrival Time} - (\text{Clock Edge} + \text{Hold Time})
  \]

---

## Practical Tips

- Always enumerate every possible timing path for analysis.
- Calculate AAT, RAT, and Slack at each node—write values down for clarity.
- Take advantage of pessimism removal in STA tools; helps avoid over-design.
- Study edge cases: worst-case for setup is slowest path, for hold is fastest path.
- Practice graphical and textual methods for depth of understanding.
